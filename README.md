# AI-Powered Image Search Application

![App Screenshot](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400?text=ImageFinder+Screenshot) *Example screenshot placeholder*

A Flask-based web application that lets you:
- Upload images with AI-generated descriptions
- Search images using natural language queries
- View visually similar images with similarity scores

## 🌟 Key Features

- **AI-Powered Descriptions**: Uses SmolVLM via llama-server to generate image captions
- **Semantic Search**: Leverages all-MiniLM-L6-v2 for text-to-image similarity matching
- **Modern UI**: Responsive design with dark/light mode toggle
- **Drag & Drop**: Easy image upload interface
- **Local First**: All processing happens on your machine

## 🛠️ Installation Guide

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Git
- Git LFS (for model downloads)
- Basic terminal knowledge

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-search-app.git
cd image-search-app

Step 2: Set Up the Environment

    Create and activate a virtual environment:
    bash

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows

Install Python dependencies:
bash

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Step 3: Download AI Models

    SmolVLM Model (for image descriptions):
    bash

llama-server -hf ggml-org/SmolVLM-500M-Instruct-GGUF

Keep this running in a separate terminal

Sentence Transformer Model (for text similarity):
bash

    mkdir -p models
    git lfs install
    git clone https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 models/all-MiniLM-L6-v2

Step 4: Folder Structure Verification

Ensure your project looks like this:
text

image-search-app/
├── app.py
├── static/
│   ├── uploads/          # Will be created automatically
│   └── style.css
├── templates/
│   └── index.html
├── models/
│   └── all-MiniLM-L6-v2/ # 80MB model files
├── requirements.txt
└── README.md

🚀 Running the Application

    First terminal (Llama server):
    bash

llama-server -hf ggml-org/SmolVLM-500M-Instruct-GGUF

Second terminal (Flask app):
bash

python app.py

Open your browser to:
text

    http://localhost:5000

🖼️ How to Use

    Upload Images:

        Click the upload zone or drag & drop images

        Supported formats: JPG, PNG, WEBP

        Each image will be processed by SmolVLM

    Search Images:

        Type natural language queries (e.g., "red car at sunset")

        Results show by relevance with match percentages

    Toggle Theme:

        Click the moon/sun icon to switch between dark/light modes

⚠️ Troubleshooting

Problem: Descriptions not generating
✅ Solution: Ensure llama-server is running and accessible at http://localhost:8080

Problem: "Model not found" errors
✅ Solution: Verify the all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model is in the correct location:
bash

ls models/all-MiniLM-L6-v2
# Should show pytorch_model.bin and other files

Problem: Slow performance
✅ Try these optimizations:

    Reduce image sizes before uploading

    Increase similarity threshold in app.py (search for similarity > 0.5)

    Use fewer images (start with <100)

# AI Image Search with Semantic Understanding

![App Preview](https://via.placeholder.com/1200x600/6e48aa/ffffff?text=AI+Image+Search+App)

A complete local-first solution for visually searching your image collection using:
- 🖼️ **SmolVLM** for image understanding (via llama-server)
- 🔍 **all-MiniLM-L6-v2** for semantic search
- 🚀 **Flask** backend with modern frontend

## 📦 Quick Setup

### 1. Clone & Prepare
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-search-app.git
cd image-search-app
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
# venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Get AI Models
bash

# For image descriptions (run in separate terminal)
llama-server -hf ggml-org/SmolVLM-500M-Instruct-GGUF

# For text similarity
mkdir -p models
git lfs install
git clone https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 models/all-MiniLM-L6-v2

3. Launch Application
bash

python app.py

💡 Usage Tips

    For Best Results:

        Use clear, high-quality images

        Images with distinct subjects work best

        Optimal search queries: "dog playing fetch", "mountain sunset", "office workspace"

    Keyboard Shortcuts:

        Enter in search box = perform search

        Escape = clear search

    Advanced Options:

        Adjust similarity threshold in app.py (line 115)

        Change port by modifying app.run() parameters
